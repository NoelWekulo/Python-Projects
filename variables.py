# In summary:
#
# List: Ordered and flexible (like a to-do list).
# Tuple: Ordered and unchangeable (like coordinates).
# Set: Unordered and unique (like a guest list).
# Dictionary: Unordered and key-based (like a contact list).

# Summary
# Lists: Flexible and support many methods for adding, removing, and modifying items.
# Tuples: Immutable; support limited methods for counting and indexing.
# Sets: Unordered, do not allow duplicates, support set-specific operations like union and intersection.
# Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, allow specific methods for accessing and manipulating data by key.
# Each data type has a distinct purpose, and youâ€™ll choose one based on your needs (e.g., use a list for ordered data, a set for unique items, a tuple for fixed data, and a dictionary for key-value mappings).
# Let me know if you want more details on any of these!
